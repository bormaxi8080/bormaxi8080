# OSINTech GitHub Page

Hi all, I am Maxim Marshak, OSINT & investigations enthusiast, software developer and technical communications specialist.

My expertise encompasses the development of OSINT solutions, including parsers, scrapers, and systems for analyzing unstructured data. I am skilled in backend technologies such as Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl, and Bash, and have a solid foundation in database management and DevOps practices. Driven by a passion for research and innovation, I strive to enhance data-driven decision-making and investigative capabilities.

With over 4 years of experience in OSINT, I specialize in internal investigations, and research and development (R&D). At Tesari AI, I contribute as an OSINT Engineer and library curator, ensuring the effective collection and management of data for actionable insights. My work is rooted in leveraging advanced methodologies to support investigative processes and organizational objectives.

## Projects Examples

## My Profile Notices

Unlike many people who are interested in OSINT and information security, I do not seek to be anonymous, and information about me is open to a reasonable extent. This is a principled position aimed at popularizing research activities and supporting democratic values ​​in the world.

For quite a long time I was engaged in hiring specialists in IT and took about 260 families outside RF. With the beginning of war in Ukraine, I left Russia, and I do not consider offers from Russian corporations, state structures, and office work within Russia. Now I live in other countries.

In parallel with development and investigations, I was involved of various communities, including non-core for IT, and met a lot of interesting and famous people: social activists, journalists, politically concerned citizens, HR, PR people, developers, security specialists, etc. At a certain point, this activity logically led me to become interested in OSINT.
