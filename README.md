Hi all, I am @bormaxi8080, aka Maxim Marshak, OSINT & investigations enthusiast, software developer and technical communications specialist.

I develop and investigate People, Companies and Incidents Data on Python, Ruby, JS, Perl, Bash with OSINT, Cybesecurity & DevOps activities and practices.

I focused on collecting various data about individuals, companies, structures and incidents and develop OSINT solutions related to this topic, as well as a variety of parsers, scrapers, systems for comparing and analyzing poorly structured data. I have extensive experience in hiring in the IT and periodically act as a communicator in various technical communities, and actively participate in open source development.

Previously I acted as head hunter targeted for positions in IT level from middle+, with relocation outside Russia, write about hiring, HR Tech, development and participate in various professional communities.

### My Profile Notices:

Unlike many people who are interested in OSINT and information security, I do not seek to be anonymous, and information about me is open to a reasonable extent. This is a principled position aimed at popularizing research activities and supporting democratic values ​​in the world.

For quite a long time I was engaged in hiring specialists in IT and took about 250 families outside RF. With the beginning of war in Ukraine, I left Russia, and I do not consider offers from Russian corporations, state structures, and office work within Russia. Now I live in other countries.

In parallel with development and hiring in IT, I was involved in development of various communities, including non-core for IT, and met a lot of interesting and famous people: social activists, journalists, politically concerned citizens, HR, PR people, developers, security specialists, etc. At a certain point, this activity logically led me to become interested in OSINT.
