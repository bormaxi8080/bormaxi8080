Hi all, I am @bormaxi8080 (https://twitter.com/HiddenDjoker) aka Maxim Marshak, sociopathic cat lover, technical hiring specialist, OSINT enthusiast and software developer with journalism and DevOps activities.

I Develop in Python, Node.js, GoLang, Perl, Bash.
Sometimes I hire people targeted for positions in the IT level from middle+, with relocation outside the Russian Federation. 
Write about hiring in IT, HR Tech, development, I participate in various professional communities.

### Main projects:

- [Bormaxi About Hiring](https://github.com/bormaxi8080/bormaxi-about-hiring): Hiring Notes in IT and international recruitment (on examples with cats, obscene language and naked truth), not finished

### My profile notices:

Unlike many people who are interested in OSINT and information security, I do not seek to be anonymous, and information about me is open to a reasonable extent. This is a principled position aimed at popularizing research activities and supporting democratic values ​​in the world.

For quite a long time I was engaged in hiring specialists in IT and took about 150 families outside the Russian Federation. With the beginning of the war in Ukraine, I left Russia.

In parallel with the development and hiring in IT, I was involved in the development of various communities, including non-core for IT, and met a lot of interesting and famous people: social activists, journalists, politically concerned citizens, HR, PR people, developers, security specialists, etc. At a certain point, this activity logically led me to become interested in OSINT.

This is a rather non-standard path in a career, but the circumstances have developed )
