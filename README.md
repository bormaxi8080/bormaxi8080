Hi all, I am @bormaxi8080 (https://twitter.com/HiddenDjoker) aka Maxim Marshak, sociopathic cat lover, technical hiring specialist, OSINT enthusiast and software developer with journalism and DevOps activities.

I Develop in Python, Node.js, GoLang, Perl, Bash.

Write about hiring in IT, HR Tech, development, I participate in various professional communities.

### My technology stack:

- Async.IO, AIOgram, Google API, Nest.js, Express, REST API, Swagger, Selenium, mutli threading, multi processssing, sharding, etc.

- Perl, Bash, and at different times a bunch of all sorts of exotics, mainly integration, for parsing, scraping and data enrichment

- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali Linux, Amazon Linux, Mikrotik OS), AWS, MacOS, Windows, Docker - at the level of normal DevOps

- Java, C++, .NET - at the level of “I can, but without fanaticism”

- PHP - at the level of “collect or fix something quickly”

- Vue, React - at the level of understanding how it works (there is no industrial experience in frontend development)

- UX, Figma, CSS, Styles - I can make it nice if needed

### My profile notices:

Unlike many people who are interested in OSINT and information security, I do not seek to be anonymous, and information about me is open to a reasonable extent. This is a principled position aimed at popularizing research activities and supporting democratic values ​​in the world.

For quite a long time I was engaged in hiring specialists in IT and took about 150 families outside the Russian Federation. With the beginning of the war in Ukraine, I left Russia.

In parallel with the development and hiring in IT, I was involved in the development of various communities, including non-core for IT, and met a lot of interesting and famous people: social activists, journalists, politically concerned citizens, HR, PR people, developers, security specialists, etc. At a certain point, this activity logically led me to become interested in OSINT.

This is a rather non-standard path in a career, but the circumstances have developed.
